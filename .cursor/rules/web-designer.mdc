# Taiwan-specific UI/UX design rules

- Create clean and intuitive interfaces with a focus on minimalism, which tends to resonate well with Taiwanese users.
- Prioritize a mobile-first design approach as smartphone usage is prevalent in Taiwan.
- Use bright and pastel color schemes which are often preferred in Taiwanese design aesthetics.
- Implement responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.
- Leverage visual elements and icons that are culturally relevant and easy to interpret for Taiwanese users.
- Enhance navigation by using both English and Traditional Chinese for better accessibility and reach.
- Offer clear and concise UI elements that minimize cognitive load, using whitespace effectively.
- Optimize for fast loading speeds, which are crucial for retaining user attention on mobile devices.
- Follow local data protection regulations to ensure user privacy and trust.

1. Color Style
Utilize bright and warm color tones, such as blue (trustworthy), red (passionate), green (natural), and gold (premium feel).​

Avoid overly flashy or oversaturated color combinations; Taiwanese users prefer fresh, soft, and minimalist styles.​

Refer to common Taiwanese brand color schemes, such as E.SUN Bank (green), PChome (blue and red), 7-Eleven (orange and green).​

2. Layout
Center-align main content sections to ensure visual balance, avoiding excessive left or right alignment.​

Use Chinese font sizes between 12 to 16px to maintain readability. Headlines can be set between 18px to 24px, with bolding to highlight key points.​

Employ ample white space to prevent information from appearing too cluttered, ensuring visual clarity.​

Prioritize mobile-first design to guarantee a positive experience for mobile users.​

3. Typography
Use fonts familiar to Taiwanese users, such as Noto Sans TC, Source Han Sans, Microsoft JhengHei, to ensure readability.​

Avoid obscure or overly artistic fonts, as they can diminish trust and readability.​

Maintain line spacing around 1.5 times to enhance readability and comfort.​
Cursor Rules

4. Buttons & Interaction
Buttons should provide clear click feedback effects (e.g., color change, shadow, gradient) to enhance interactive experience.​

Primary buttons are recommended to have rounded corners (border-radius: 8px to 12px) to avoid a rigid appearance.​

Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons should emphasize color contrast (e.g., red background with white text, blue background with white text) to attract clicks.​

Form input fields should clearly distinguish states (focus, error, success) to improve usability.​

5. Taiwanese User Preferences
Provide social login options such as "Facebook, LINE, Google", as these are commonly used by Taiwanese users.​

Shopping carts should display "FamilyMart, 7-Eleven pickup and payment" options, as these are popular logistics and payment methods in Taiwan.​

The website should offer a "Traditional Chinese" language switch to cater to the Taiwanese market.​

Implement a night mode (Dark Mode) option, considering that Taiwanese users often browse on mobile devices for extended periods; night mode can reduce eye strain.​

6. SEO & Performance Optimization
Ensure the website achieves a "Google PageSpeed Insights" score above 85 to guarantee fast loading speeds.​

Use WebP format for images to enhance loading speed, avoiding overly large PNG or JPG files.​

Include keywords such as "Taiwan, local, official, discount" in website titles and descriptions to improve SEO performance.​

Support OpenGraph (OG) tags to ensure correct preview images and descriptions when shared on social media.
